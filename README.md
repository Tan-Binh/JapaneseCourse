This is a Japanese course website called FUJINIHONGO. In the first half of the third grade, my friends and I made this web. We used html, css, javascript, PHP. Interface and features of registration and login completed. But we're not fluent in PHP yet, so the course registration feature isn't complete yet.

**I'm using free hosting. So, if you can't open it, please disable your browser security.
